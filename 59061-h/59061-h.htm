<br /><span class="smallest">by Robert F. Clarke</span></span></h1>
<p>Many persons either do not know
anything at all about the poisonous
snakes of our state or have a distorted
group of misconceptions concerning
them. These misconceptions
run from plain misknowledge
about the range or identification of
poisonous snakes to fancifully
elaborate stories in which there
may or may not be the barest
thread of fact.</p>
<p>The prime reason that every person
should know the poisonous
snakes of his region by sight and
know something about their habits,
distribution, and abundance is that
it will ease the mind of the average
individual in all of his outdoor pursuits.
Most persons have heard so
many false stories about snakes that
they develop a fear of <i>all</i> snakes.
<i>This fear is unfounded!</i> A person
who knows what poisonous snakes
he can expect to encounter in a
given area need only learn to identify
these and realize that <i>all other
snakes</i>, <i>lizards</i>, <i>frogs</i>, <i>toads</i>, <i>salamanders</i>,
and <i>turtles</i> do not have a
poisonous bite, and, therefore, he
need not fear them. With a
knowledge of the poisonous snakes,
a person can avoid places where
these snakes might be found. Another
aspect is the <i>conservation</i> of
snakes. Too many people kill snakes
just because they happen to be
snakes. This is uncalled for destruction&mdash;a
non-poisonous snake should
no more be killed than a song bird.
In many cases, the harmless snakes
are of direct economic value.</p>
<p>In general, all snakes are similar
in habits. In Kansas, they retire for
the winter in places where the
temperature will not get below the
freezing point. These may be in
rocky ledges, beneath the soil, below
the roots of trees, or in protected
places of human design, such
as grain bins, cisterns, cellars, and
silos. With the warm days of spring,
the snakes emerge from their winter
quarters and set about finding
food and mates. After mating, the
sexes separate and each individual
snake goes its own way to forage
for food for the rest of the year.
Some snakes lay eggs and others
produce the young alive. There is
about an even division of these
types in Kansas. The king snakes,
rat snakes, bull snakes, racers, and
many smaller snakes lay eggs in
early summer. These eggs are deposited
in a spot suitable for hatching,
generally beneath a rock or in
the soil. When they hatch, the
young fend for themselves. In Kansas,
water snakes, garter snakes,
poisonous snakes, and some smaller
snakes give birth to living young
in late summer or early fall. Again,
the young are on their own after
birth. With the coming of cooler
weather the snakes leave their
summer feeding grounds and travel
to places where they will hibernate
for the winter.</p>
<p class="tb">MYTHS: Probably no other group of
animals has had the variety and expanse
of tall tales credited to them as have the
snakes. As the stories go, there are snakes
<span class="pb" id="Page_4">4</span>
that can put their tails in their mouths
and roll downhill hoop-like, snakes that
are capable of milking cows dry, snakes
that fly into pieces when struck and later
reassemble into whole snakes again,
snakes that charm their prey, and others
too numerous to mention here. Some of
these tales deal specifically with the poisonous
power of snakes or with snakes that
are venomous. There is the &ldquo;Blow viper,&rdquo;
whose very breath is poisonous! The butt
of this fable is the utterly harmless hog-nosed
snake, pictured on <a href="#Page_13">Page 13</a>. Many
persons think that the poisonous &ldquo;fang&rdquo;
of a snake is the structure which is frequently
flicked in and out of the snake&rsquo;s
mouth. This is really its tongue, and is
present in <i>all</i> snakes. The &ldquo;fang&rdquo; is an enlarged
tooth in the upper jaw (see diagram,
<a href="#Page_5">page 5</a>). Four of the many untruths
about poisonous snakes are (1)
rattlesnakes cannot cross a horsehair
rope&mdash;<i>they can</i>! (2) cottonmouth water
moccasins cannot bite under water&mdash;<i>they
can</i>! (3) rattlesnakes always rattle
before they strike&mdash;<i>not always</i>! (4) the
rattles present on the tail of a rattlesnake
indicate the snake&rsquo;s age&mdash;<i>no</i>, a new segment
is added each time that the skin is
shed, which may occur several times during
a year.</p>
<p class="tb">FOOD: Most of the adult poisonous
snakes of Kansas consume only warm-blooded
prey, consisting primarily of
small rodents: white-footed mice, shrews,
voles, and cotton rats in the fields, and
house mice and rats about human habitations.
Small birds and young rabbits
may be taken, as well as occasional lizards
and insects. The copperhead is more
insectivorous than the rattlesnakes, and
the cottonmouth feeds upon other creatures
that inhabit the edges of waterways.</p>
<p>The poison of venomous snakes is not
only a defensive mechanism, but also a
highly efficient food-getting device.
Whereas some of the snakes strike and
hold the prey within their jaws until the
poison has rendered it helpless, others
only strike and follow the trail to where
the victim falls.</p>
<p>In feeding, the snake does not chew its
food, but swallows it whole. The jaws are
wonderfully adapted for this purpose,
having the bones on each side of the jaws
attached to their mates on the other side
by an elastic ligament, and the upper and
lower jaws also joined by such an attachment.
This allows the jaws to be spread
apart and lowered, making an opening
capable of taking in a food item actually
larger in diameter than the snake! The
teeth of both the upper and lower jaws
are recurved, pointing inward, and as
each section of the jaw can work independently,
one side secures its grip while
the other side moves forward. Thus, the
snake actually crawls around its food.</p>
<p class="tb">ABUNDANCE: The non-poisonous
snakes far outnumber the poisonous
kinds, both in number of species and individuals.
In the United States, there are
approximately 95 species of non-poisonous
snakes and only 19 species of
poisonous ones, including 15 rattlesnakes,
one copperhead, one cottonmouth, and
two coral snakes. In Kansas, there are six
species of poisonous snakes (two should
hardly be counted) and 34 species of
non-poisonous snakes. Many of the non-poisonous
species are common and widespread.
It is far more probable that any
snake seen is non-poisonous than
poisonous.</p>
<p class="tb">SNAKE BITE: Venom is secreted from
glands within the head, on each side behind
the eyes, causing the swollen appearance
of the head in this region. The
venom travels through ducts to each of
the two fangs. The fangs are enlarged
teeth in the front of the upper jaw. They
are hollow, with one end connected to the
poison duct and the other end having an
opening on the front edge near the tip.
The fangs are also fastened to a moveable
bone, which enables the fangs to be
<span class="pb" id="Page_5">5</span>
folded back against the upper jaw when
the mouth is shut and erected and directed
forward when the mouth is opened
to strike. The power of a strike imbeds
the fangs into the skin of the victim, and
muscles force venom from the glands
through the duct and hollow fang and
out of the opening at the tip. The venom
causes a breakdown of the red blood
corpuscles and walls of blood vessels. It
also has an effect upon the nervous
system. Some snakes have venom which
is much more destructive to the nervous
system. The pit vipers have venom which
is more <i>hemotoxic</i> (destructive to blood),
whereas the coral snake, which belongs to
the cobra group, has a venom which is
<i>neurotoxic</i> (destructive to nerves).</p>
<p>The venom is yellowish and somewhat
&ldquo;thicker&rdquo; than water. The amount of
poison ejected at any one strike varies
from a part of a drop to 2 cubic centimeters,
depending upon size and kind of
snake, and time elapsed since last venom
ejection. Various factors influence the
amount of venom which is injected into
the victim, i.e., smaller snakes have
smaller fangs and less venom; strikes
through clothing or footwear are less effective.</p>
<p>It has been estimated that there are
fewer than 50 deaths due to snake bite
in the United States in a year; most of
these bites result from imprudent
handling of venomous serpents. There has
been no survey of snakebite in Kansas,
but few deaths are reported annually. At
times several years have elapsed without
any deaths being reported. Most victims
are less than 20 years of age and most
bites occur on the hands, feet, arms, or
legs.</p>
<p>It should be stressed that poisonous
snakes cannot be made harmless by removing
the fangs. The poison glands and
ducts remain and other teeth can still
scratch the skin, allowing entrance of the
venom. Also, &ldquo;reserve&rdquo; fangs are normally
present. These are immature fangs
lying along the upper jaw bone. At intervals
a reserve fang grows down beside
a fang which has been used for some
time. The old fang is shed and a new
sharp &ldquo;hypodermic needle&rdquo; is in position.
Thus, snakes are sometimes found with
three or four fangs.</p>

<p>Snake venom is used to manufacture
<i>antivenin</i>, which is injected into snakebite
victims to help counteract the effects of
the poison. The venom is injected in
graduated doses into horses, which build
up an immunity to the venom. Blood is

is processed to produce antivenin.</p>
<h3 id="c1"><span class="sc">How To Tell A Poisonous From A Non-Poisonous Snake In Kansas</span></h3>
<p>The features given here apply only to
Kansas snakes and may not be applicable
elsewhere. Even in Kansas, there are
some non-poisonous snakes which exhibit
either the tail or eye characteristics given
for poisonous snakes, but none have the
pit. It probably need not be pointed out
that these features can be seen only when
<span class="pb" id="Page_6">6</span>
the snake can be examined closely. Certainly,
every snake should not be picked
up to look for these characteristics! A
warning is necessary at this point&mdash;reflex
action can cause an apparently &ldquo;dead&rdquo;
snake to bite, so do not handle &ldquo;dead&rdquo;
snakes with the hands; use a stick. The
best way to be able to identify a poisonous
snake is to know <i>all</i> of the venomous
snakes of your region by sight. Color and
pattern are distinctive and are easily
learned.</p>

<p><span class="small">COPPERHEAD</span> (<i>Agkistrodon contortrix</i>).
Length usually 2-3 feet. Common where
it occurs, the copperhead is probably the
most abundant poisonous snake in eastern
Kansas. It is most frequently found in the
vicinity of rocky ledges in oak-hickory-walnut
woods, but it ranges widely, so
that individuals may be found in almost
any habitat during summer months. Although
generally nocturnal during most
of its active season, its habit of lying in
the open during the daytime among dried
leaves in patches of sunlight and shadow
causes the pattern to blend perfectly with
the background. Any hiker through this
habitat should be alert. Because of the
rather small size, usually inoffensive disposition,
and the low toxicity of its venom
this snake should be placed on the non-fatal
list for adults. Elderly persons, those
in poor health, or small children could
find the copperhead bite fatal, however.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02s.jpg" alt="Map" width="465" height="244" />
</div>
<p>A subspecies of the copperhead occurs
along the southern border of Kansas. In
this form, the crossbands are wider along
the mid-line than the more northern variety.</p>
<p>Young copperheads have a sulfur-yellow
tail. This color is lost as the snake
matures. It is thought that this contrasting
tail color is used as a lure to bring prey
within striking distance of the small
snake. The young are born in August or
September. There may be from two to ten
in a litter.</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p><span class="small">COTTONMOUTH</span> (<i>Agkistrodon piscivorus</i>).
Length 3-4 feet. The poisonous
water moccasin has been taken only once
in Kansas. This was on the Neosho River
in Labette County at the Cherokee
County line. It is on the basis of this
single specimen that it is counted as one
of the snakes of Kansas! The many general
reports of water moccasins in Kansas
refer to the mistaken identification of
the harmless water snakes that are common
throughout most of the state (see
<a href="#Page_12">page 12</a>). Young cottonmonths are patterned
quite like a wide-banded copperhead,
but the colors are not so reddish.
These snakes are always found in the vicinity
of water. When approached they
quite often hold their ground and open
their mouths widely, revealing the white
lining of the mouth, a habit which gives
them their common name. This heavy-bodied
snake is dangerously poisonous
and, contrary to popular belief, can bite
underwater.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p02t.jpg" alt="Map" width="466" height="254" />
</div>
<p>Whereas the copperhead is a rather
mild-mannered snake, the cottonmouth
has a vicious disposition. Although nocturnal,
it likes to sun-bathe, and it is frequently
seen basking along shorelines,
stretched out on low branches or upon
the bank. Where this snake occurs, it is
usually common.</p>
<p>Generally, eight or nine young are born
in August or September, although the
number of young may range from five to
fifteen. Like the copperhead, the young
have a yellow tail tip.</p>

<p><span class="small">MASSASAUGA</span> (<i>Sistrurus catenatus</i>).
Length 24-27 inches. This snake belongs
to a group of small rattlesnakes called
&ldquo;ground&rdquo; or &ldquo;pygmy&rdquo; rattlers, which are
differentiated from the larger rattlers by
having paired scales on top of the head,
as have the copperhead, cottonmouth,
and non-poisonous snakes. The massasauga
occurs in open fields and rocky
outcroppings. It is particularly common
in the Flint Hills. This is the &ldquo;prairie
rattler&rdquo; of eastern Kansas, often found
under hay bales in fields. Its food consists
primarily of small rodents. The small
size and usually docile disposition of this
snake tend to place it upon the non-dangerous
list, but its venom is extremely
toxic, and <i>any</i> bite from a poisonous snake
is dangerous. When aroused, these small
snakes strike with a fury not seen in the
larger snakes. The rattling of this small
snake is hardly louder than the buzz of a
grasshopper.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04.jpg" alt="Map" width="464" height="247" />
</div>
<p>The name &ldquo;massasauga&rdquo; is an Indian
term, meaning &ldquo;swamp dweller,&rdquo; a habitat
preference which is evidenced more in
the states to the northeast of Kansas.</p>
<p>Two subspecies occur in Kansas. In the
eastern part of the state is the form that
occurs eastward of Kansas, characterized
by the dark belly; the lighter-bellied form
extends westward from eastern Kansas
into states to the southwest.</p>
<p>About eight or nine young are born,
usually in August or September.</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p><span class="small">WESTERN DIAMOND-BACKED RATTLESNAKE</span>
(<i>Crotalus atrox</i>). Length 4-5 feet, although
some are larger. In the United
States, probably more deaths are caused
by this snake than by any other. A combination
of large size, wide distribution,
abundance, and touchy temperament
give this distinction to this snake. It is
hardly a member of the Kansas snake fauna,
having been found only twice in the
state, both times in the southeastern corner.
It should occur, although presently
unrecorded, in south-central Kansas along
the Oklahoma line. It is rather common
in Oklahoma, just south of this region.
The diamond-back prefers dry open
plains and canyons, where it feeds upon
small rodents, young rabbits, and occasionally,
birds. The ground color varies
somewhat from buff to gray; the snake
generally has a faded appearance. The
black and white tail bands are distinctive.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04a.jpg" alt="Map" width="471" height="256" />
</div>
<p>About ten young are born in late summer
or early fall. Larger litters have been
recorded. The young are fully capable of
inflicting a dangerous bite as soon as they
are born&mdash;and quite willing to do so!</p>
<p>In northern Oklahoma, an annual
rattlesnake roundup is held, in which
several hundred diamond-backs are captured.
These are processed for their
venom, from which antitoxin is made.
Some of the rattlesnakes are cooked and
their steaks used in a banquet. The meat
is firm and quite tasty!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_11">11</div>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p><span class="small">TIMBER RATTLESNAKE</span> (<i>Crotalus horridus</i>).
Length 3-4 feet, occasionally
longer. The timber rattler occurs only in
eastern Kansas and is only locally common,
at scattered localities. It prefers the
deciduous forest where limestone rock
outcrops as ledges, but may wander into
cultivated fields and open areas during
late spring and summer. The food consists
primarily of small rodents and young
rabbits. Ordinarily, it is a mild-mannered
snake, one which will seek to escape direct
contact with man, but its size and
habit of living close to human habitations
necessitate considering this rattler dangerous.
Ground color may vary from a
light gray to yellow, with the black chevron-shaped
blotches of the back uniting
with lateral blotches to form crossbands.
Another common name for the timber
rattler is <i>banded rattlesnake</i>. Some individuals
may be almost <i>all</i> black. The tail
is characteristically velvet black in adults;
banded in young.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04c.jpg" alt="Map" width="463" height="242" />
</div>
<p>During late spring and summer the
timber rattler is quite often encountered
crossing roads, where its large size and
slow movement often make it a victim of
modern transportation.</p>
<p>The timber rattler has a habit of frequently
spending daylight time just beneath
the edge of overhanging rocks. A
hiker should always look beneath any
rocks of this sort before using the rock as
a resting place.</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p><span class="small">PRAIRIE RATTLESNAKE</span> (<i>Crotalus viridis</i>).
Length 3-4 feet. This rattlesnake is common
in western Kansas, where it frequents
rocky open regions, grassy prairies,
and agricultural areas. In eastern Kansas
it has been found only in the Pittsburg
vicinity, and any &ldquo;prairie rattler&rdquo; east of
Wichita or Manhattan is usually the massasauga.
The habit of denning in large
groups is well-known. Several hundred
have been found in hibernation in a single
den. The food of the prairie rattler is
warm-blooded, mostly rodents and small
rabbits. It appears to be active in the daytime,
whereas the other poisonous snakes
are mainly nocturnal. The ground color
varies from a light gray to green, and the
pattern of dorsal blotches with alternating
rows of lateral blotches may cause it to
be confused with the smaller massasauga,
but the scales on top of the head are all
small on the prairie rattler, whereas
paired plates are present on the massasauga
(see diagram, <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>).</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p04d.jpg" alt="Map" width="464" height="245" />
</div>
<p>Young are born in late summer or early
fall. Usually nine to twelve constitute a
litter. As few as five and as many as
seventeen have been recorded, however.</p>
<p>It has been found that any one female
prairie rattler gives birth to a litter of
young every other year. These young are
generally about twelve inches in length.</p>
<p>This snake has a wide range over western
United States, where it is probably
the most common rattlesnake. It is frequently
found in prairie dog villages. The
burrows of these animals are utilized as
shelter and the young are used as food
items.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small"><span class="ss"><span class="large">Some Common Harmless Snakes</span></span></span></h2>
<p>The following six snakes are representative of the harmless snakes
commonly and incorrectly thought to be poisonous by the general public.</p>
<p class="tb">1. HOG-NOSED SNAKE. Length 2-2&frac12; feet. This is the &ldquo;blow viper,&rdquo;
&ldquo;spreadhead viper,&rdquo; &ldquo;spreading adder,&rdquo; or other equally ill-named snake
usually found in dry sandy areas. It has a threatening defensive bluff which
consists of spreading the fore part of the body cobra-like, hissing and striking
(but with mouth closed). Failing to intimidate its opponent, the snake
will contort its body convulsively and roll onto its back&mdash;apparently dead.
It will remain inert unless rolled over onto its stomach; then it will roll onto
its back again&mdash;the only proper attitude for a dead snake!</p>
<p class="tb">2. BLUE RACER. Length 3-4 feet. Many stories are told about this
snake attacking persons. It is doubted that most are true interpretations of
fact. These rapid-moving snakes may come at a person who is in line with
the snake&rsquo;s preconceived idea of an escape route. Upon capture, most blue
racers will bite, but they are definitely non-poisonous. These snakes feed
mostly upon small rodents. The color varies in individuals from blue-green
to olive or olive-brown; underside is yellow.</p>
<p class="tb">3. COMMON WATER SNAKE. Length 2-3 feet. This snake and the
yellow-bellied water snake, of very similar appearance, are the most often
noted snakes along creeks, rivers, lakes, and ponds. These are usually the
&ldquo;moccasins&rdquo; that frighten persons near water. Entirely harmless, but with
a vicious disposition, these snakes feed upon small fish, frogs, and other
creatures that inhabit their neighborhood.</p>
<p class="tb">4. DIAMOND-BACKED WATER SNAKE. Length 3 feet. Heavy
body, dark appearance, and mean disposition give this particular snake a
bad reputation. More than any other Kansas snake, this one gives rise to
stories of the poisonous cottonmouth being distributed throughout eastern
and southern portions of the state. It is always found in the vicinity of
water and feeds upon creatures it finds there.</p>
<p class="tb">5. PILOT BLACK SNAKE. Length 5-6 feet. Also more properly
called the black rat snake, a descriptive title which is particularly apt. Occasionally,
this large snake may find where hen eggs are available and become
a nuisance in the hen house, but the wise farmer who allows one of
these snakes to stay around the barn and corncrib will reap dividends from
the destruction wrought upon the rodent population. This snake is a much
better mouser than any cat!</p>
<p class="tb">6. RED MILK SNAKE. Length 2-3 feet. A beautiful jewel of a
snake, this small creature has been credited with the ability to milk a cow
dry! Such a feat is impossible for a number of reasons. This reputation was
acquired because this snake was frequently found in barns, where it had
gone in search of mice, a favorite food item. The color pattern might be
confused with that of the poisonous coral snake (not found in Kansas). In
the coral snake, however, the red and yellow rings are adjacent.</p>

<h3 id="c4"><span class="sc">Treatment of Snake Bite</span></h3>
<p>If possible, determine definitely if the
snake is poisonous. If it is not, no treatment
is necessary other than application of
an antiseptic. If the snake is poisonous,
typical symptoms will appear rapidly:
bruised appearance at bite, noticeable
swelling, and intense pain. Later, the victim
may become nauseated and may even
faint. The important thing to do is to <b>get
to a doctor or a hospital as soon as possible</b>.
In the meantime, the following measures
should be taken to retard the spread of the
venom.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>1. Place tourniquet between bite and

<p>Upon arrival at doctor&rsquo;s or hospital, antivenom
may be injected after the determination
for serum sensitivity. Antivenin may
be administered by a person other than a
doctor, but this is recommended only in
cases where a doctor or hospital is not
readily accessible.</p>
<p>Snake bite kits are available at most
drug stores and should be carried by persons
or groups going into areas inhabited
by poisonous snakes.</p>

<h3 id="c7">ABOUT THIS ISSUE</h3>
<p>The <a href="#cover">cover picture</a> is a copperhead. This
snake was photographed alive, but somewhat
anesthetized with ether, by Dr. John
Breukelman and the author, using a
single-lens reflex 35 mm. camera, type A
Kodachrome film and two photofloods. The
illustrations on <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a> were taken by
these same two, using a Polaroid Land
camera, photofloods, and graduate student
George Ratzlafl as victim. The line drawings
and color illustrations were made by
the author. The color plates of non-poisonous
and poisonous snakes were
painted in water colors, using live and preserved
snakes as models. The original
paintings have been reduced one-half in
this publication.</p>
<hr class="dwide" />
<p>Poisonous snakes are only one aspect of
the study of <b>herpetology</b>, which includes
other reptiles, as well as <b>amphibians</b>. These
together may be referred to as <b>herptiles</b>.
There are 97 species of herptiles in Kansas:
9 salamanders, 20 frogs and toads, 15
lizards, 40 snakes, and 13 turtles. The
turtles of Kansas have been described in a
past issue of <b>The Kansas School Naturalist</b>
(April, 1956), and an issue on the lizards of
the state is in preparation.</p>

Creating the works from print editions not protected by U.S. copyright
law means that no one owns a United States copyright in these works,
so the Foundation (and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United
States without permission and without paying copyright
royalties. Special rules, set forth in the General Terms of Use part
of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works to protect the PROJECT GUTENBERG-tm

specific permission. If you do not charge anything for copies of this
eBook, complying with the rules is very easy. You may use this eBook
for nearly any purpose such as creation of derivative works, reports,
performances and research. They may be modified and printed and given
away--you may do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks
not protected by U.S. copyright law. Redistribution is subject to the
trademark license, especially commercial redistribution.

and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or

things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic works if you follow the terms of this

States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg-tm mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg-tm
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg-tm name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg-tm License when
you share it without charge with others.

1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are

agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg-tm work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country outside the United States.

1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg-tm License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg-tm work (any work

phrase "Project Gutenberg" is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:

  This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and
  most other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no
  restrictions whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it
  under the terms of the Project Gutenberg License included with this
  eBook or online at www.gutenberg.org. If you are not located in the
  United States, you'll have to check the laws of the country where you
  are located before using this ebook.

1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg-tm electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase "Project

will be linked to the Project Gutenberg-tm License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.

License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg-tm.

Gutenberg-tm License.

1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg-tm work in a format
other than "Plain Vanilla ASCII" or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg-tm web site

provided that

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
  legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
  payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
  Section 4, "Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg
  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

* You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS', WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.

1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org



Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation

The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation is a non profit
501(c)(3) educational corporation organized under the laws of the
state of Mississippi and granted tax exempt status by the Internal
Revenue Service. The Foundation's EIN or federal tax identification
number is 64-6221541. Contributions to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation are tax deductible to the full extent permitted by
U.S. federal laws and your state's laws.

The Foundation's principal office is in Fairbanks, Alaska, with the
mailing address: PO Box 750175, Fairbanks, AK 99775, but its
volunteers and employees are scattered throughout numerous
locations. Its business office is located at 809 North 1500 West, Salt
Lake City, UT 84116, (801) 596-1887. Email contact links and up to

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
